## Working

The home page displays a dashboard summarizing key metrics and functionalities. A sidebar enables easy page navigation, while the second page handles order management, offering updates and deletions. The third page focuses on product management, categorizing listings and allowing updates and deletions. The fourth page gives a calender view to display orders on their expected delivery dates and view all orders due for delivery that day. Responsive design ensures compatibility across devices.
